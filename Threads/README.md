Design of Assignment:
For Threads lab,
ArrayList is being used as data structure for the ready queue
Scheduling of threads is done using round robin algorithm.
Round Robin:
Time slices (200) are assigned to each thread in equal portions and in circular order, handling all threads without priority (also known as cyclic executive).

Responsibility of Group Members:
We all read first 3 chapters from Introduction to Operating Systems Design and Implementation.
Then with the combined efforts of all three of us we wrote the program code according to manual and then solved exceptions and errors thrown by the code
