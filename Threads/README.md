Design of Assignment:
<br/>
For Threads lab,
ArrayList is being used as data structure for the ready queue
Scheduling of threads is done using round robin algorithm.

Round Robin:
Time slices (200) are assigned to each thread in equal portions and in circular order, handling all threads without priority (also known as cyclic executive).
