# CIS657-OSP2
POS OSP2 Projects

The student module dealing with the creation and killing of
    tasks.  A task acts primarily as a container for threads and as
    a holder of resources.  Execution is associated entirely with
    threads.  The primary methods that the student will implement
    are do_create(TaskCB) and do_kill(TaskCB).  The student can choose
    how to keep track of which threads are part of a task.  In this
    implementation, an array is used.
